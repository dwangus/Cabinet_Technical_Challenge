This challenge has three parts with graudated levels of difficulty. Each part builds on the last,
so you will need to implement them in order. Additionally, parts 2 and 3 are more open-ended than
part 1-- you are encouraged to step outside the confines of the blueprint I provide, and build
something interesting.

jQuery, Underscore, RSVP and QUint are provided as libraries. Use additional libraries if you
believe they would help.

Challenges:

1. SimpleMessageQueue. See:
  - simple_message_queue.html
  - simple_message_queue.js
  - simple_message_queue_tests.js

All tests are provided. You should only need to edit simple_message_queue.js


2. QueueWithPromises. See:
  - queue_with_promises.html
  - queue_with_promises.js
  - queue_with_promises_tests.js

Some tests are provided. You will need to edit queue_with_promises.js and
queue_with_promises_tests.js


3. NaiveMapReduce. See:
  - naive_map-reduce.html
  - naive_map_reduce.js (add this file yourself)
  - naive_map_reduce_tests.js

No tests are provided, though I've included some example code (to demonstrate how the API could
look). I've also provided a brief specification of the expected behavior.
